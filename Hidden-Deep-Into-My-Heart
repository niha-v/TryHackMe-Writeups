Room Name: Hidden Deep Into My Heart
Difficulty: Easy/Medium

Tools Used: Nmap, Gobuster, Browser DevTools

Phase 1: Reconnaissance
Network Scanning: Ran nmap to identify open ports. Found port 5000 hosting a web server.

Directory Discovery: Used gobuster to find hidden endpoints. Found /cupids_secret_vault/ and /administrator.

Phase 2: Vulnerability Analysis
Inspected the /robots.txt file which is a common place for misconfigurations.

Finding: Discovered a sensitive comment in the file: # cupid_arrow_2026!!!.

Phase 3: Exploitation
Attempted administrative login at /administrator.

Credential Bypass: Used the discovered string from robots.txt as the password for the admin user.

Result: Successfully authenticated and gained access to the vault/dashboard.

Lessons Learned
Always check "low-hanging fruit" like robots.txt and source code comments before launching heavy brute-force attacks.

Properly configuring robots.txt is vital; it should never contain credentials or hints for attackers.
